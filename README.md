This is the repository for the individual project in Advanced Topics in Natural Language Processing 2024 (University of Copenhagen), aiming at fine-tuning a pre-trained T5 Small on the SCAN task (Lake & Baroni 2018, dataset avalable [here](https://github.com/brendenlake/SCAN), evaluating compositional generalization in transformers.

<br>
In order to train the model and run the experiments, make sure to install the requirements.txt and run Experiment1.ipynb and Experiment2.ipynb respectively. Make sure to specify the directory containing the data and the output directory in the beginning of both notebooks (the easiest way is to run them is in Kaggle). The plots and results for the experiments will be shown as an output and additionally saved as JSON files and images in your specified output folder.
